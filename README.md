# HealthCare

Health Care is an automated system that is made up of PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and MYSQL for the database. The main purpose of this Online Health Care system is to help improve and optimize all the processes within the institution. This Online Health Care system has two sides, an admin and a user.

As technology advances nowadays, it is also important for the health care systems to automate all the processes which will help improve customer service and reduce the waiting time. Unlike the manual process, that essential information cannot be available in the necessary time as there are volumes of information that cannot be done if you do not have enough manpower. In this Online Health Care System, the user must register to have an account so; he can book an appointment and can get locations of the nearest hospitals with their respected names. The user also has the ability to see on the Home page different doctors assigned in the hospital along with their professions. They can also view the contact list of the admin, so the user can send a message directly to them
